## FAQ

* Why?

  We mostly use a light variant (300) of Source Sans Pro in our CI and any newer
  version and any version not based on the OTF variant looks horrible on low DPI
  screens on Windows and, to some extend, on Linux as well.

* Why OTF and not TTF?

  The TTF variant is hard to read on Windows with a low-DPI screen and a font
  weight of 300, OTF looks good on the other hand.

* Do I need to do this for every font?

  https://github.com/fontsource/fontsource has nice subsetted npm packages for
  various fonts. I'd try that first.

  Also see https://markoskon.com/creating-font-subsets for a nice article on the
  topic of subsetting.

## Rebuilding the fonts

* `poetry install`
* `poetry run bash build.sh`
