## Attributes

- `lang` (optional, default: `de`): set to `de` or `en` for German or English
    - example `<dbp-organization-select lang="de"></dbp-organization-select>`
- `entry-point-url` (optional, default is the TU Graz entry point url): entry point url to access the api
    - example `<dbp-organization-select entry-point-url="http://127.0.0.1:8000"></dbp-organization-select>`
- `value` (optional): api path of organization to preload the selector with
    - example `<dbp-organization-select value="/people/testuser"></dbp-organization-select>`
    - the `value` will also be set automatically when an organization is chosen in the selector
- `context` (optional): the context of the returned organizations
    - example `<dbp-organization-select context="libray-manager"></dbp-organization-select>` returns all organizations
      where the current user is library manager
    - if no `context` is set all organizations are returned that are in a relation with the current user
- `data-object` (read-only): when an organization is selected the organization object will be set as json string
    - example `<dbp-organization-select data-object="{"@id":"/organizations/1190-F2050","@type":"http://schema.org/Organization","identifier":"1190-F2050","name":"Institut für Stahlbau","url":"https://online.tugraz.at/tug_online/wborg.display?pOrgNr=1190","alternateName":"F2050"}"></dbp-organization-select>`
- `auth` object: you need to set that object property for the auth token
    - example auth property: `{token: "THE_BEARER_TOKEN"}`
    - note: most often this should be an attribute that is not set directly, but subscribed at a provider
